\title{Render R Markdown report with organized output structure}
\usage{
render_report(report, rerun = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{report}{Character string specifying the path to the R Markdown file to render.
Expected to be in format "reports/{date_created}_{name}/report.Rmd" where the subdirectory
name will be used for organizing outputs.}

\item{rerun}{Logical indicating whether to rerun cached chunks. Default is FALSE.
When TRUE, forces re-execution of cached code chunks.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the rendered HTML file. The function is
called primarily for its side effect of creating the rendered report.
}
\description{
Renders an R Markdown report to HTML with automatic directory organization
and naming conventions. The function creates a dated output directory structure
and passes parameters for title, cache path, and rerun options.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Extracts subdirectory name from the report path (second path component)
\item Removes prefix from subdirectory name to create a clean report name
\item Creates output directory: "reports/{date_created}\emph{{name}/YYYYMMDD/"
\item Generates output filename: "YYYYMMDD}{name}.html"
\item Sets up cache directory: "reports/{date_created}\emph{{name}/YYYYMMDD/YYYYMMDD}{name}_cache/"
\item Passes parameters to the R Markdown document: title, cache_path, rerun
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Render a report located at "reports/20250820_mutation_analysis/report.Rmd"
render_report("reports/20250820_mutation_analysis/report.Rmd")

# Force rerun of cached chunks
render_report("reports/20250820_mutation_analysis/report.Rmd", rerun = TRUE)

# This would create:
# - Output directory: reports/20250820_mutation_analysis/20250828/
# - HTML file: 20250828_mutation_analysis.html
# - Cache directory: reports/20250820_mutation_analysis/20250828/20250828_mutation_analysis_cache/
